1.  The Network
    -   An authenticated peer-to-peer network in which a node is simply a JVM runtime environment
        -   A node is added to the network after taking permission from the network controller
        -   Each node on a given network must have an identity certificate signed by the network root certificate authority CA
        -   This network root CA generates a Doorman Certificate Authority and Network Map Certificate Authority
        -   For a node to join a network, the node must have a certificate signed by all three certificate authorities
        -   The nodes communicate using a wireless protocol to validate and create transactions
        -   Each node is a JVM runtime environment that manages that manages Corda services and executes Corda decentralized applications
    -   Need-to-know basis shareability
        -   Message transmission is done on a need to know basis in the Corda network.
        -   It means data is not globally broadcast over the network.
        -   It is only transmitted to the relevant parties at the time of their need
    -   The flow of all communication between nodes is straightforward
        -   Messages are TLS-enrypted and sent over AMQP/1.2
    -   IP addresses of nodes through which nodes can be reached are publised by network map service
        -   Each network maintains its own network map services
    -   Every Corda network have doorman service
        -   To join a network, a node must first contact the doorman and provide the required information.
    -   The Corda Network consists of two network services
        -   Notary Services
        -   Oracle Services

        1.  Notary Services:
            -   Ensures transaction integrity to prevent double spend and replay attacks on the network
        
        2.  Oracles Services:
            -   Oracles are network services that provides commands that encapsulates those specific facts that result in disagreement

2.  Corda Node
    -   Corda Node is a JVM run-time environment with a unique identity.
    -   Hosts Corda services and CorDapps

    Architecture
    -   A node has two different interfaces
        -   Network Interface: a node uses this to interact with other nodes in the network
        -   RPC Interface: uses this to interact with the owner of the network
    -   A node consists of:
        - Two databases:
            -   Vault: Stores relevant information extracted from the ledger
            -   Persistence Layer: Extracts and retrieves information from external databases like SQL DB and stores them in a relational model
        -   Storage Service: Provides services used for accessing data stored in node storage.
        -   Network Interface
            -   Nodes interact with each other in the network via Remote procedure calls
        -   RPC Interface
            -   Allows node'S owner to interact with the node
        -   The Service Hub
            -   Nodes use a set of services used during the flow execution to coordinate the ledger updates in the network.
            -   A service hub allows the node flow to call these node services
        -   The CorDApp provider
            -   An interface where new Corda applications, extending the node's behaviour
3.  Transactions
    -   Transactions in Corda are proposals to update the ledger.
        -   A transaction is committed if 
            -   It does not contain a double spent state
            -   Is completely validated
            -   Is fully signed
        -   If any of the above is absent, the transaction is stopped and the flow is aborted.
    -   UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model is ued by Corda
    -   Every state on the ledger is immutable
    -   Ledger evolvement happens while applying transactions
    -   Transactions are atomic in nature
        -   Either all the changes in the proposed transaction are accepted or not.

    ### Types of Transactions
    -   Notary change transactions which are used to change as state's notary
        -   Used to change the notary of a state in a transaction
    -   General transactions used for everything else
        -   Are normal transactions

    ### Components of Transaction:
    -   Commands
    -   Attachments
    -   Signers
    -   Time-window
4.  Consensus
    -   Corda has a pluggable consensus that allows the notary clusters to select the consensus algorithm based on their requirements in terms of
        -   Privacy
        -   Scalability
        -   Algorithmic agility
        -   Legal system compatibility
    -   In pluggable consensus, we use  pluggable notaries which are services that provide transaction ordering and time stamping.
        -   Consensus algorihm is divide
    Transactions must achieve uniqueness and validity consensus in order to be committed
    -   Validity Consensus
        -   Verifies that a transaction has the signatures of all of the transaction's participants of the transaction
    -   Uniqueness Consensus
        -   Uniqueness Consensus must be achieved by a transaction proposal to be valid
        -   Checks if any of the inputs to a propsed transaction has already been consumed by another transaction or not
        -   A single Corda network may contain multiple notaries that provide their guarantees using various consensus algorithms
5.  Contracts
    -   A contract is self-governing terms and conditions, purposeful and legal binding between two or more parties
    -   Contract of every input and output states must accept a valid transaction
    -   Contracts of every input and output states must accept a valid transaction
    -   Contracts are always written in JVM programming language e.g. Kotlin or Java
    -   The Contract execution is deterministic, and the transaction's content alone decides the acceptance of a transaction.

    ### Verification and Validity of Transaction
    -   The contract must be pointed by each state
    -   As input, a contract takes a transaction, and as output, it states that whether the transaction can be considered as valid based on contract rules
    -   The validity of transaction depends if the contract of every input state and every output state acknowledges it to be valid
6.  Identity
    -   In Corda, an identity represents:
        -   An organization's legal identity
            -   Parties involved in transaction use their legal identities
            -   Doorman must sign and attest the identities by the X.509 Certificates
            -   Only attested and well-known identities are published on the network map
        -   Identities can be confidential, which are only shared on a need-to-know basis
        -   Nodes must verify the identity of the owner of a public key, which can only be achieved by X.509 certificates
7.  Flows
    -   Point-to-point messaging is used in Corda networks
    -   What information needs to be sent, to which counterparties, and in what order to be sent, it is all required from network participants at the time of ledger update
    -   Telling a node that how to achieve a specific ledger update
    -   Library of flow is provided by Corda to store common tasks so that developers do not have to redefine the logic for common processes.
8.  Time Windows
    -   Specify a time window within which a particular transaction claims to occur
    -   Expressed as windows, as there is no true time in distributed system.
9.  Notaries
    -   Notary service provides uniqueness consensus which prevents double-spends and replay attacks on a network
        -   If any of the input states have been consumed in a network by a previous transaction, the notary service will cause a rejection of the transaction
        -   A notary cluster will only sign a transaction if it is the appointed notary cluster of all of the input state of the proposed transaction
    -   Each state has their appointed notary which notarize a transaction and all transaction's input states
    -   A Network can have several notaries and each running different consensus algorithm
    -   Flag and reject the transaction if double-spent attempt is detected

    ### Notaries in different terms
    Notary clusters in corda contains:
    -   Structure
        -   Means that a notary cluster may be 
            -   a single node, 
            -   several mutually trusting nodes
    -   Consensus Algorithm
        -   Notary cluster could also differ by algorithm
        -   A Notary cluster could choose to run on a high speed cluster algorithm or any other consensus algorithm

    ### Multiple Notaries
    -   There can be multiple notaries in each corda network, each of which runs different consensus algorithms that provides
        -   Privacy
        -   Scalability
        -   Load-balancing
        -   Low-latency
10. Oracle
    -   As a part of a command, a fact can be included in a transaction
    -   Oracle is defined as a service which will only sign transaction if the included fact is true
    -   Oracle provides commands to encapsulate a specific fact (e.g. exchange rate), and Oracle is listed as a required signer.
    -   Oracle uses Merkle trees to "tear off" the transaction.
