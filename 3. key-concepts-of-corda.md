# Key Concepts

-  Key concepts of Corda include
    1.  Network
    2.  Nodes
    3.  Transactions
    4.  Consensus
    5.  Contracts
    6.  Identity
    7.  Flow
    8.  Time windows
    9.  Notary Services
    10. Oracle Services

    
1.  The Network
    -   An authenticated peer-to-peer network in which a node is simply a JVM runtime environment
        -   A node is added to the network after taking permission from the network controller
        -   Each node on a given network must have an identity certificate signed by the network root certificate authority CA
        -   This network root CA generates a Doorman Certificate Authority and Network Map Certificate Authority
        -   For a node to join a network, the node must have a certificate signed by all three certificate authorities
        -   The nodes communicate using a wireless protocol to validate and create transactions
        -   Each node is a JVM runtime environment that manages that manages Corda services and executes Corda decentralized applications
    -   Need-to-know basis shareability
        -   Message transmission is done on a need to know basis in the Corda network.
        -   It means data is not globally broadcast over the network.
        -   It is only transmitted to the relevant parties at the time of their need
    -   The flow of all communication between nodes is straightforward
        -   Messages are TLS-enrypted and sent over AMQP/1.2
    -   IP addresses of nodes through which nodes can be reached are publised by network map service
        -   Each network maintains its own network map services
    -   Every Corda network have doorman service
        -   To join a network, a node must first contact the doorman and provide the required information.
    -   The Corda Network consists of two network services
        -   Notary Services
        -   Oracle Services

        1.  Notary Services:
            -   Ensures transaction integrity to prevent double spend and replay attacks on the network
        
        2.  Oracles Services:
            -   Oracles are network services that provides commands that encapsulates those specific facts that result in disagreement
