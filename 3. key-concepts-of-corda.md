1.  The Network
    -   An authenticated peer-to-peer network in which a node is simply a JVM runtime environment
        -   A node is added to the network after taking permission from the network controller
        -   Each node on a given network must have an identity certificate signed by the network root certificate authority CA
        -   This network root CA generates a Doorman Certificate Authority and Network Map Certificate Authority
        -   For a node to join a network, the node must have a certificate signed by all three certificate authorities
        -   The nodes communicate using a wireless protocol to validate and create a transaction
    -   Need-to-know basis shareability
    -   The flow of all communication between nodes is straightforward
        -   Messages are TLS-enrypted and sent over AMQP/1.2
    -   IP addresses of nodes through which nodes can be reached are publised by network map service
    -   Every Corda network have doorman service
    -   The Corda Network consists of two network services
        -   Notary Services
        -   Oracle Services
