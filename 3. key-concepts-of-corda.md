    1.  Network
    2.  Nodes
    3.  Transactions
    4.  Consensus
    5.  Contracts
    6.  Identity
    7.  Flow
    8.  Time windows
    9.  Notary Services
    10. Oracle Services

    
1.  The Network
    -   An authenticated peer-to-peer network in which a node is simply a JVM runtime environment
        -   A node is added to the network after taking permission from the network controller
        -   Each node on a given network must have an identity certificate signed by the network root certificate authority CA
        -   This network root CA generates a Doorman Certificate Authority and Network Map Certificate Authority
        -   For a node to join a network, the node must have a certificate signed by all three certificate authorities
        -   The nodes communicate using a wireless protocol to validate and create transactions
        -   Each node is a JVM runtime environment that manages that manages Corda services and executes Corda decentralized applications
    -   Need-to-know basis shareability
        -   Message transmission is done on a need to know basis in the Corda network.
        -   It means data is not globally broadcast over the network.
        -   It is only transmitted to the relevant parties at the time of their need
    -   The flow of all communication between nodes is straightforward
        -   Messages are TLS-enrypted and sent over AMQP/1.2
    -   IP addresses of nodes through which nodes can be reached are publised by network map service
        -   Each network maintains its own network map services
    -   Every Corda network have doorman service
        -   To join a network, a node must first contact the doorman and provide the required information.
    -   The Corda Network consists of two network services
        -   Notary Services
        -   Oracle Services

        1.  Notary Services:
            -   Ensures transaction integrity to prevent double spend and replay attacks on the network
        
        2.  Oracles Services:
            -   Oracles are network services that provides commands that encapsulates those specific facts that result in disagreement

2.  Corda Node
    -   Corda Node is a JVM run-time environment with a unique identity.
    -   Hosts Corda services and CorDapps

    Architecture
    -   A node has two different interfaces
        -   Network Interface: a node uses this to interact with other nodes in the network
        -   RPC Interface: uses this to interact with the owner of the network
    -   A node consists of:
        - Two databases:
            -   Vault: Stores relevant information extracted from the ledger
            -   Persistence Layer: Extracts and retrieves information from external databases like SQL DB and stores them in a relational model
        -   Storage Service: Provides services used for accessing data stored in node storage.
        -   Network Interface
            -   Nodes interact with each other in the network via Remote procedure calls
        -   RPC Interface
            -   Allows node'S owner to interact with the node
        -   The Service Hub
            -   Nodes use a set of services used during the flow execution to coordinate the ledger updates in the network.
            -   A service hub allows the node flow to call these node services
        -   The CorDApp provider
            -   An interface where new Corda applications, extending the node's behaviour
3.  Transactions
    -   Transactions in Corda are proposals to update the ledger.
        -   A transaction is committed if 
            -   It does not contain a double spent state
            -   Is completely validated
            -   Is fully signed
    -   UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model is ued by Corda
    -   Every state on the ledger is immutable
    -   Ledger evolvement happens while applying transactions
    -   Transactions are atomic in nature

    ### Types of Transactions
    -   Notary change transactions which are used to change as state's notary
    -   General transactions used for everything else

    ### Components of Transaction:
    -   Commands
    -   Attachments
    -   Time-window
