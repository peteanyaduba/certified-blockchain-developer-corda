# Corda Architecture

-   Corda Architecture is made up of the following components
    -   Flow framework: sequence of steps that tells the node how to achieve a specific ledger update
    -   Notary service: to provide uniqueness consensus attestation for transaction to prevent double spends
        -   Until the notary cluster signature is obtained, parties cannot ensure that the equally valid but conflicting transactions will not be regarded as a valid attempt to spend a given input state
    -   Attachments: inlcude certificates
        - Legal documents
        - Contract codes
        - Confidential encypted sections that are extensions of the main contract states of the transaction
        - Identified by their hash value
    -   Vault: contains data extracted from ledger relevant to owner of node in form of relational model
        -   Contains the head of the ledger states to be easily queried
        -   Also has a private key that is used to sign the transactions that consume some states in the vault
        -   Keeps track of both unconsumed and consumed states
        -   Unconsumed or unspent states represents fungible states available for spending or consumption
        -   Spent states represent immutable states for transaction reporting, archival or analysis
            -   Spent states cannot be modified directly being immutable
            -   It represents facts known by one or more Corda nodes for some specific period
    -   States: an immutable objet that represents facts which are known by one or more nodes at a specific point of time
        -   Corda states contain arbitrary data which allows them to represent facts like 
            -   Identifying information
            -   Loans data
            -   Stocks, etc
            -   Contains reference to the Corda contract that governs the expansion of the state over a period of time
            -   States are defined as instances of classes
    -   Network Map: published index of IP addresses of nodes in the network
        -   It also contains a network map
