# Corda Data Structures

1.  Data Structure is a functional configuration of organizing and storing data.   
    -   Data structures include:
        -   Arrays
        -   Lists
        -   Records
        -   Files
        -   Tables
        -   Trees
    -   **Hash Tree:** Corda uses the Hash Tree concept in storing data
        -   Hash Tree allows for a secure and efficient verification of the content of the large data structure.
        -   In Corda, the concept of the hash tree is used to restrict the network's data sharing
        -   **Hash Table:** Data Structure is used in providing easier data processing and management with the help of **Hash Table**
            -   It provides security by restricting data access to unauthorized parties and avoiding data tampering
2.  Corda Data Structures contains two parts
    -   **The Ledger**
    -   **The States**

## Ledger

1.  Ledger is chronological storage of facts or records order
2.  Facts are like rows in a table
3.  All peers to a shared fact stores the identical records
4.  Corda nodes use distributed ledger mechanism
5.  Each peer only sees a subset of facts on the ledger, and no peer is aware of the ledger in its entirety
6.  No single data storage, each node maintains a separate database
