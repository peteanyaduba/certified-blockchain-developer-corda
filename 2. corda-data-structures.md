# Corda Data Structures

1.  Data Structure is a functional configuration of organizing and storing data.   
    -   Data structures include:
        -   Arrays
        -   Lists
        -   Records
        -   Files
        -   Tables
        -   Trees
    -   **Hash Tree:** Corda uses the Hash Tree concept in storing data
        -   Hash Tree allows for a secure and efficient verification of the content of the large data structure.
        -   In Corda, the concept of the hash tree is used to restrict the network's data sharing
        -   **Hash Table:** Data Structure is used in providing easier data processing and management with the help of **Hash Table**
            -   It provides security by restricting data access to unauthorized parties and avoiding data tampering
2.  Corda Data Structures contains two parts
    -   **The Ledger**
    -   **The States**

## The Ledger

1.  Ledger is chronological storage of facts or records order
    -   Defined as a sequenced unchangeable record of all the states of transitions inside the node
2.  Ledger stores records in the form of facts
    -   Facts are like rows in a table
    -   Ledger is a set of immutable states
    -   Each node in a network is likely to have a unique ledger of its own
    -   It means a distributed ledger mechanism
    -   Every peer only has access to a part of the ledger and does not have a global access to the ledger
    -   If one of these facts is shared by multiple nodes on the network, facts are locked in the database for every node using the **Lock Step** mechanism
    -   Lock-Step is a **fault tolerant mechanism** used to avoid redundancy by allowing error-detection and error correction
3.  All peers to a shared fact stores the identical records
    -   Any changes to the shared facts are visible to the node sharing the fact
4.  Corda nodes use distributed ledger mechanism
5.  Each peer only sees a subset of facts on the ledger, and no peer is aware of the ledger in its entirety
6.  No single data storage, each node maintains a separate database

## The State
1.  State is an immutable object that represents facts with are know by one or more nodes at a specific point of time. 
    -   Data is not modified directly
2.  State are declared as a rational mapping and can be queired using SQL
3.  Contains arbitrary data, which allows representation of data in any kind
4.  State contains reference to Contracts, that overn the evolution of state
5.  States are never altered, they are either uncomsumed (or unspent) or consumed (or spent)
