# Corda Data Structures

1.  Data Structure is a functional configuration of organizing and storing data.   
    -   Data structures include:
        -   Arrays
        -   Lists
        -   Records
        -   Files
        -   Tables
        -   Trees
2.  Corda Data Structures contains two parts
    -   **The Ledger**
    -   **The States**

## Novel Features of Corda

1.  Corda has no unnecessary global sharing of data
    -   Data is shared only on a need-to-know basis
2.  All messages shared are TLS-encrypted and sent over AMQP/1.0
3.  Message senders need to know the identity of recipients.
4.  Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) used for recording states (just like Bitcoin)
5.  Corda supports a variety of consensus mechainisms
    -   Corda is not restricted to only one consensus algorithm
6.  Transactions are validated by parties involved in that transaction rather than a broader pool of independent validators
7.  Corda records an explicit link between human-language legal prose documents and smart contract code
8.  Corda suppor industry-standard protocols AMQP,JDBC, etc

## Why Corda is limited to transactions

1.  In traditional blockchain, when adding a block to the blockchain, the process is distributed across the network of nodes
    -  As a result, the process is time-consuming
    -   In Corda, when adding a block to the blockchain, only relevant parties are involved saving time.
2.  In traditional blockchain, entire history of transactions of all previous blocks are captured. In Corda, only transactions from elated parties are captured to protect privacy.
    -   Not node has the entire history of all the transactions in the network
    -   This makes Corda suited for banking where data privacy is more important
    -   Hence, transaction details are private, limited to only involved parties
    -   It can also check if a state consumed by a given service or transaction has been consumed before.
        -   This helps to eliminate double spending

3.  Benefits
    -   Transaction details are maintained privately, increasing scalability
    -   Uniqueness is maintained with validation available over P2P
